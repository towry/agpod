A powerful agent helper tool for optimizing git diffs for LLM context and managing PR drafts locally.

## Features

### Diff Minimization
- **Smart summarization**: Large files (>100 changes) show metadata only
- **Token optimization**: Removes excessive empty lines while preserving structure
- **Save mode**: Split diffs into reviewable chunks with status tracking

### Kiro Workflow
- **PR draft management**: Organize design docs, tasks, and implementation notes locally
- **Template system**: Customizable templates for different project types
- **Git integration**: Auto-create branches and manage workflow state

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/towry/agpod/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Requirements:** macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/towry/agpod.git
cd agpod
cargo build --release
# Binary available at target/release/agpod
```

## Usage

### Diff Minimization

```bash
# Minimize a git diff
git diff | agpod diff

# Save chunks for review workflow
git diff | agpod diff --save

# Custom output path
git diff | agpod diff --save --save-path custom/path

# Integration examples
git diff | agpod diff | pbcopy              # Copy to clipboard (macOS)
git diff | agpod diff > minimized_diff.txt  # Save to file
```

**Save mode** creates separate chunk files with `REVIEW.md` for tracking review status. See [SAVE_OPTION_SUMMARY.md](SAVE_OPTION_SUMMARY.md) for details.

### Kiro Workflow

```bash
# Initialize configuration and templates
agpod kiro init

# Create a new PR draft
agpod kiro pr-new --desc "implement user login"

# Create with template and git branch
agpod kiro pr-new --desc "add JWT module" --template rust --git-branch

# List PR drafts
agpod kiro pr-list

# Interactive PR selection
agpod kiro pr
```

See [KIRO_GUIDE.md](KIRO_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive workflow documentation.

## How It Works

### Diff Minimization Strategy

1. **Large files** (>100 changes or >500 lines): Shows metadata only (filename, change type, line count)
2. **Regular files**: Preserves full diff with reduced empty lines (max 2 consecutive)
3. **All file types**: Handles added, deleted, modified, and renamed files
