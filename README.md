A powerful agent helper tool for optimizing git diffs for LLM context and managing PR drafts locally.

## Features

### Diff Minimization
- **Smart summarization**: Large files (>100 changes) show metadata only
- **Token optimization**: Removes excessive empty lines while preserving structure
- **Save mode**: Split diffs into reviewable chunks with status tracking

### Kiro Workflow
- **PR draft management**: Organize design docs, tasks, and implementation notes locally
- **Template system**: Customizable templates for different project types
- **Git integration**: Auto-create branches and manage workflow state

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/towry/agpod/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Requirements:** macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/towry/agpod.git
cd agpod
cargo build --release
# Binary available at target/release/agpod
```

## Usage

### Diff Minimization

```bash
# Minimize a git diff
git diff | agpod diff

# Save chunks for review workflow
git diff | agpod diff --save

# Custom output path
git diff | agpod diff --save --save-path custom/path

# Integration examples
git diff | agpod diff | pbcopy              # Copy to clipboard (macOS)
git diff | agpod diff > minimized_diff.txt  # Save to file
```

**Save mode** creates separate chunk files with `REVIEW.md` for tracking review status. See [SAVE_OPTION_SUMMARY.md](docs/SAVE_OPTION_SUMMARY.md) for details.

### Kiro Workflow

```bash
# Initialize configuration and templates
agpod kiro init

# Create a new PR draft
agpod kiro pr-new --desc "implement user login"

# Create with template and git branch
agpod kiro pr-new --desc "add JWT module" --template rust --git-branch

# List PR drafts
agpod kiro pr-list

# Interactive PR selection
agpod kiro pr
```

See [KIRO_GUIDE.md](docs/KIRO_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive workflow documentation.

## Configuration

agpod supports feature-specific configuration through `config.toml` files. Configuration can be placed at:

- **Global**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agpod/config.toml` or `~/.config/agpod/config.toml` - Applies to all projects
- **Project**: `.agpod.toml` in project root - Project-specific overrides

The global configuration location respects the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable, making it easy to test different configurations without affecting your default setup.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change in v0.5.0**: The configuration format has changed to use structured sections. The old flat format is no longer supported. You must update your config files to use `[kiro]` and `[diff]` sections.

### Configuration Structure

The configuration file uses a versioned schema to track changes and ensure compatibility:

```toml
# Configuration version (current: "1")
version = "1"

# Kiro workflow settings
[kiro]
base_dir = "llm/kiro"
templates_dir = "~/.config/agpod/templates"
template = "default"

# Diff minimization settings
[diff]
output_dir = "llm/diff"
large_file_changes_threshold = 100
large_file_lines_threshold = 500
max_consecutive_empty_lines = 2
```

The `version` field helps track configuration schema changes over time, allowing agpod to:
- Detect deprecated configuration options
- Provide migration warnings when needed
- Maintain compatibility across versions

See [examples/config.toml](examples/config.toml) for a complete configuration example.

## Architecture

agpod is built as a modular Rust library with clean separation of concerns:

- **`agpod::diff`** - Git diff minimization and processing logic
- **`agpod::kiro`** - PR draft workflow management  
- **`agpod::config`** - Unified configuration system

This modular design allows:
- Easy addition of new features
- Publishing individual modules as libraries
- Clear separation between features
- Independent testing of each component

## How It Works

### Diff Minimization Strategy

1. **Large files** (>100 changes or >500 lines): Shows metadata only (filename, change type, line count)
2. **Regular files**: Preserves full diff with reduced empty lines (max 2 consecutive)
3. **All file types**: Handles added, deleted, modified, and renamed files

## Development

agpod is structured as a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

- **agpod-core**: Core configuration and utilities
- **agpod-diff**: Git diff minimization functionality
- **agpod-kiro**: PR draft workflow management
- **agpod**: CLI binary that integrates all features

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/towry/agpod.git
cd agpod

# Build all workspace crates
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run linting
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Format code
cargo fmt --all
```

### Workspace Structure
